This is my wishlist for the wizard component

- implement the Java 1.1 AWT API to wizard component

- change the event-driven notification system to a Listener-type one

- inform the parent application of every page change

- ability to handle action butons in the wizard

- add a help button for the specified page

- implement a message box for use in the wizard
