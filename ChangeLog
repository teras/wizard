These are the major changes of the wizard component

02-Sep-98
V 0.9.0  - Almost all my wishlist is finished (see TODO file). If I manage to
           create a proper interface for applets and clean up some dirty code
           I'll release V 1.0 !

01-Sep-98
V 0.8.2+ - A lot of changes, most of them very importand.
           Transformation to Java 1.1 finished. Also added interface-driven
           event handler for the wizard information event. Added ability to
           display little help messages. From this release onward only Java 
           V 1.1 compatible and not applet compatible.
